                                                to work as intended. You can either allow or deny the

                                                necessary for you to grant the Software permissions to take
                                                full advantage of features or functionality of the Software.
                                                If you disallow some or all permissions, the Software may
                                                not function properly. Some of the permissions needed may
                                                include access to your device’s: camera; calendar; location;
                                                phone; sensor; SMS; and storage. Additional permissions may
                                                be requested as new features are added in the future.
